## 🧠 What Is a Fall Guys Cheat?

A **Fall Guys cheat** is a tool that injects code into the game to give you unfair (and hilarious) advantages — like *flying over obstacles*, *grabbing without being grabbed*, or *auto-finishing races*. Instead of battling RNG physics, you become the broken mechanic.

These cheats are perfect for casual trolling, speedrunning crowns, or just flexing in chaotic minigames.
